# Starting with F sharp

This repository will be used to store some initial level projects written in F#. F# (reads F sharp), is a functional language maintaned by Microsoft and works like a functional version of the C# language, also backed by Microsoft.

For the Ionide extension to work correctly in my environment (Ubuntu 20.04 + VS Code) I had to downgrade its version to the 4.17.0.

Some definitions of this universe of functional programming:

* Pure function -> Returns constant output for a given input. It's a deterministic function, so it doesn't have side effects. This last property means that there are no changes in the system or other system (mutable state, database updates, web requests, IO).

## Run the project:

```bash
# must have the dotnet installed
$ dotnet run
```
